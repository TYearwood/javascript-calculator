# Programming Test: Array Calculator
As a group, create a basic calculator, which takes an array of numbers and performs a basic mathematical operation (add, subtract, multiple, divide).  This should produce the correct output for all the numbers.
You can decide to use JavaScript, C# or even pseudo code. 

Instructions:
•	This test is designed to assess your group's programming skills in designing and implementing a calculator that performs operations on an array of numbers.

•	Please do not use AI, remember problem solving and coding is fun 😊.  So, try and enjoy this challenge, you may use Google to search specific syntax.

•	You need to collaborate within your group members to solve the tasks.

•	Please decide as a group either to use TDD (Test Driven Development) or create unit tests afterwards. It's very important to know you've got the correct result.
