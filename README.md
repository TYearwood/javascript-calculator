# Programming Test: Array Calculator

As a group, create a basic calculator, which takes an array of numbers and performs a basic mathematical operation (add, subtract, multiple, divide). This should produce the correct output for all the numbers. You can decide to use JavaScript, C# or even pseudo code.

**Instructions**: 

 -  This test is designed to assess your group's programming skills in
   designing and implementing a calculator that performs operations on
   an array of numbers.
   
 - Please do not use AI, remember problem solving and coding is fun
   ðŸ˜Š. So, try and enjoy this challenge, you may use Google to search
   specific syntax.
   
 - You need to collaborate within your group members to solve the
   tasks.
   
 - Please decide as a group either to use TDD (Test Driven
   Development) or create unit tests afterwards. It's very important to
   know you've got the correct result.


Remember, the goal of this test is to assess your group's ability to collaborate, design a program, and implement the required functionalities within a 30 minute time limit. Good luck!
